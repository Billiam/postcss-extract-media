# 0.0.1

The first release. Don't use it.

# 0.0.2

Yay, now it's a little bit more stable.
- Changed a the workflow of the app ([PR #8](https://github.com/Ghostavio/postcss-extract-media/pull/8));
- Changed the name of the plugin to *postcss-extract-media* (Closes [#5](https://github.com/Ghostavio/postcss-extract-media/issues/5));
- Use PostCSS 5.0 API (Closes [#2](https://github.com/Ghostavio/postcss-extract-media/issues/2));
- Writing file from within the plugin now, so no need to `append` leaving all the work for Grunt as it was happening before (Closes [#3](https://github.com/Ghostavio/postcss-extract-media/issues/3));

There are still work to be done here, but it's way better than the first version.
Thanks to @davidecantoni, @ai and @joaocunha for the help.
